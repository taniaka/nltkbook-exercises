    "De las colocaciones de \"The Man Who Was Thursday\" se desprende que se podría tratar de una novela policíaca (\"Inspector Ratcliffe\", \"Scotland Yard\", \"police station\"). Y basándonos en las colocaciones de \"Alice\", podemos deducir que muchos de los personajes son animales (\"Mock Turtle\", \"March Hare\", etc.), por lo que debería tratarse de un cuento fantástico. También algunas colocaciones parecen indicar que en el libro hay mucho diálogo (\"said Alice\", \"trembling voice\", \"dead silence\", \"yer honor\", \"Alice replied\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalmente he mirado las concordancias de \"rich\" and \"poor\" en los dos textos. En el texto de Chesterton ambas palabras se usan tanto en relación con la situación económica de una persona o entidad (\"rich man\", \"the poor have been rebels\"), como en el sentido figurativo de \"abundante\" o \"suntuoso\" para \"rich\" (\"rich athmosphere\") y de desgraciado para \"poor\" (\"poor old Colonel\"). En el libro de Carrol la riqueza material, al parecer, no tiene mucha transcendencia. \"Rich\" se usa solo una vez para hablar de la sopa, mientras que \"poor\" se utiliza 27 veces y casi siempre para expresar compasión (\"poor Alice\", \"poor little things\", \"my poor hands\")."
