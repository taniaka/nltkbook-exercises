## NLTK book exercises

Jupyter notebooks with my solutions to the exercises from the oficial [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/).  

The most straightforward exercises have been omitted and some of the solutions include comments in Spanish.

These notebooks have been created as part of the [GAPLEN project](http://gaplen.readthedocs.io/es/latest/) (Grupo de Aprendizaje de Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural).
